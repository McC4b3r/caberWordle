# Sandbardle

Welcome to Sandbar's take-home interview: Sandbardle.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Interview Prompt

Create a game similar to [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html),
except where you allow words with that are between 2 and 5 characters long.
All other rules stay the same.

The rules of wordle are as follows (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle#Gameplay)):

> ... a five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries.
> After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray:
> green indicates that letter is correct and in the correct position,
> yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position,
> while gray indicates it is not in the answer at all.
> Multiple instances of the same letter in a guess, such as the "o"s in "robot",
> will be colored green or yellow only if the letter also appears multiple times in the answer;
> otherwise, excess repeating letters will be colored gray.

For this take-home interview, please create a variant of wordle that also allows words that have 2 to 4 letters in it.

Your game should include the following:

> Basic Requirements

- random word choice on every game start
- a way to specify the answer to guess by line number of `wordlist.txt`
  - e.g. specifying `16117` in the answer specifier field should set the answer to `ocean` and clear the guesses.
  - Can only be used when starting a new game, disabled once a guess has been made
- a way to reset the game - clear the current guesses and pick a new random answer.
- an on-screen keyboard that the user can input guesses onto (both by clicking keys as buttons and by typing)

> Stretch Features

- a hard-mode toggle
  - Hard mode requires players to include letters marked as green and yellow in subsequent guesses
  - Can only be used when starting a new game, disabled once a guess has been made
- have the on-screen keyboard reflect the state of the clues (keys turn grey, yellow, and green)

Note: We care more about feature completion and code quality than aesthetic - a well-tested and readable solution that follows all instructions but looks simple will be considered above a feature-incomplete but  one.

You do **not** need to implement the following:

- Game rules (i.e. "How to Play") overlay
- Game metrics (the histogram of number of guesses)
- Dark mode / high contrast mode
- Feedback, report a bug, etc.
- Animations

### FAQ

**Can I use a library? Copy code from other sites?**

Yes, but please attribute any copied code to the original source.

You should not use an existing wordle clone, but can use components.
For example, you can use a library that renders a keyboard on-screen for the keyboard portion of the UI.

**What do I do if a user changes the game settings mid-game?**

You should not allow the user to change game settings once they start playing.
Game settings like hard mode and answer specifier should become disabled after the first guess.

**What should the layout / interface look like?**

We suggest mimicking the NYTimes's Wordle interface.

**Can I use a component library? CSS framework?**

Yes. You can choose to use whatever you're familiar with.

**Should I include a backend?**

No. The app should be self-contained as a single-page application.

**Can I use something other than react, e.g. Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.?**

No. Your proficiency with React is a part of what we are evaluating in this interview.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
